        <ul>
            <li>Understand how radiation is used to treat cancer while protecting surrounding organs.</li>
            <li>Develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills by analyzing real radiation therapy data.</li>
            <li>Design a prototype to improve shielding or targeting for radiation therapy treatments.</li>
            <li>Reflect on the ethical considerations involved in cancer treatment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Guiding Activities</h2>
        <h3>1. Case Study Analysis: Interpreting Dose Constraints</h3>
        <p>Understand how radiation is applied to treat a specific cancer area while minimizing exposure to nearby organs. Use the "boarding pass" documents provided to answer the following questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is the primary treatment area specified in your boarding pass?</li>
            <li>List the surrounding organs and their maximum dose limits.</li>
            <li>Which organs need more protection and why?</li>
            <li>Compare the maximum dose allowed for the cancerous area versus a nearby sensitive organ.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Problem-Solving Challenge: Designing an Improved Shielding Plan</h3>
        <p>Design a shielding plan that improves protection for a specific organ while maintaining effective treatment. Consider the dose constraints from your boarding pass as you answer the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify an organ that could benefit from additional shielding and explain why.</li>
            <li>Describe your proposed shielding design and the materials you would use.</li>
            <li>How would you test the effectiveness of your shielding prototype?</li>
            <li>What challenges might arise when implementing your shielding design?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Comparative Analysis: Dose Limits Across Different Cancer Treatments</h3>
        <p>Compare dose constraints for similar organs across different treatment plans using multiple "boarding pass" documents:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose two treatment plans and list the dose limits for the same organ.</li>
            <li>Create a table or chart summarizing the dose limits for each organ.</li>
            <li>Explain why the dose limits vary between different treatment plans.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Hands-On Simulation: Creating a Radiation Map</h3>
        <p>Visualize how radiation is directed at the cancerous area and how nearby organs are protected:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sketch a model of the primary treatment area and surrounding organs.</li>
            <li>Use markers or string to show radiation beams.</li>
            <li>Identify areas needing extra shielding and explain your choices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Reflection and Ethical Discussion: Balancing Treatment and Side Effects</h3>
        <p>Reflect on the ethical considerations of radiation therapy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What are the potential long-term side effects of radiation exposure to healthy tissues?</li>
            <li>How would you balance the need to treat the tumor aggressively with minimizing side effects?</li>
            <li>What ethical considerations must be kept in mind?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6. Integration with Prototype Development</h3>
        <p>Use real data to inform your prototype design decisions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Which organ would you prioritize for protection in your prototype?</li>
            <li>Describe the key features of your prototype.</li>
            <li>How does your prototype balance treatment effectiveness with minimizing exposure?</li>
        </ul>
